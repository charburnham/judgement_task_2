# Accent Credibility Experiment

This is a beginner-friendly `jsPsych` experiment for your modified version of the Lev-Ari and Keysar study.

It does all of the following:

- shows a consent form first
- shows instructions
- tells participants that the speakers did not create the statements
- tells participants that the speakers did not know whether the statements were true or false
- plays one audio recording for each stimulus
- presents each item only once, never both the `T` and `F` versions
- asks participants to judge whether the statement is true or false
- records reaction time for the judgment screen
- uploads the `.csv` data file to your OSF project through DataPipe at the end

```

## Exact setup steps in VS Code

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Install the VS Code extension called `Live Server`.
3. Put your audio files into these folders:
   - `audio/filler_talker/`
   - `audio/native_1/`
   - `audio/native_2/`
   - `audio/non_native_1/`
   - `audio/non_native_2/`
4. Open `stimuli.js` and confirm the filename prefixes match your recordings.

The current setup expects:

- main item recordings `1T` to `52F` in the four main speaker folders
- filler item recordings `F1T` to `F19F` in `audio/filler_talker/`
- filenames in the form `<prefix>_<clip_code>_audio.webm`

The current experiment plays:

- `48` critical items: main items `1` to `48`
- `16` filler items: filler items `F1` to `F16`
- `1` practice item: `F19T` only
- excluded from the experiment: main items `49` to `52`, filler items `F17`, `F18`, and `F19F`

Example:

```text
audio/native_1/ha77v84840_1T_audio.webm
audio/native_2/6nhu1nbwba_1T_audio.webm
audio/non_native_1/6bqg3s4g4q_1T_audio.webm
audio/non_native_2/2j7bwre4ol_1T_audio.webm
audio/filler_talker/7brghu4wnv_F1T_audio.webm
```

5. If your filler folder name or filler filename prefix is different, edit `FILLER_SPEAKER` in `stimuli.js`.
6. Fillers stay off until you replace the placeholder filler prefix in `stimuli.js` with the real one.
7. If you change the number of main or filler items, edit `MAIN_ITEM_COUNT` or `FILLER_ITEM_COUNT` in `stimuli.js`.
8. Save the file.
9. In VS Code, right-click `index.html`.
10. Click `Open with Live Server`.
11. The experiment will open in your browser.
12. Run one full test yourself before collecting data.
13. In `experiment.js`, replace `PASTE_YOUR_DATAPIPE_EXPERIMENT_ID_HERE` with your real DataPipe experiment ID.
14. In DataPipe, make sure your OSF account is linked and `Enable data collection` is turned on for that experiment before you run participants.

## Important note about reaction time

The reaction time is stored in the `rt` column for rows where `trial_name` is `truth_judgment`.

That means:

- `trial_name = truth_judgment` is the row you will usually analyze
- `rt` is the reaction time in milliseconds
- `participant_judgment` is the participant's true/false response
- `truth_value` is the correct answer
- `accent_group` tells you whether the speaker was `native` or `non_native`
- `speaker_id` tells you which speaker was used
- `clip_code` tells you exactly which audio clip was played
- `truth_code` tells you whether the played version was the `T` or `F` recording
- `stimulus_set` tells you whether the trial was a `main` item or a `filler`
- `is_filler` tells you whether the trial came from the filler talker

## Counterbalancing

Each participant is randomly assigned to 1 of 4 speaker lists.

This means:

- each main stimulus is presented only once to a participant
- a participant never hears both the `T` and `F` versions of the same item
- across participants, different speakers are used for the same main stimuli
- main items are balanced to half true and half false per participant
- filler stimuli stay with the dedicated filler talker and are mixed into the same randomized trial order

## If you want to add more items

Change `MAIN_ITEM_COUNT` or `FILLER_ITEM_COUNT` in `stimuli.js`, then make sure the matching audio files exist.

## If something does not work

The most common cause is a filename mismatch.

Check that:

- the filename prefix in `stimuli.js` matches the audio file
- the audio file exists in the expected folder
- each main clip exists for all four main speakers
- each filler clip exists in `audio/filler_talker/`
- you opened `index.html` with Live Server rather than double-clicking it
